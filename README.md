# On Deck Consulting    
### So a previous commit from this page mentioned that I moved it from Squarespave where it originally resided, I copied over some code from my tech portfolio site to keep as a placeholder here. I'm steadily upgrading this as I find time here and there. 

### The water fill on the landing page was from a list of animations I found. The original code on CODEPEN is [here](https://codepen.io/loaiabdalslam/embed/EEvpeP?height=316&theme-id=0&default-tab=result):


### The water drop is somethign I found on the same list of animations. The original code is by Jaron White and can be found [here](https://codepen.io/jaronwhite/embed/zrmozE?height=316&theme-id=0&default-tab=result)
